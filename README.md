# OpenCV-Face-Recognition
Using LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) Face Recognizer Algorithm based on OpenCV to Recognise Faces and detect (Haarcascade for detection) them, on trained data .

#Getting Started

In order to use this project, you'll need to install the required python packages: pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Once you're done with requirements, run the "datasetCreator.py" script. This Script will detect face and store them for training purpose.

Then run "trainner.py" script. As name suggest this will train stored data by "datasetCreator.py" script.

Now once all set up atlast run "Face_detector.py" script.
